# YouTube-video-summary-maker-Telegram-bot
I built my own bot to generate 7 key insights from videos I watch on YouTube. I love watching podcasts and editorial videos, but using GPT alone has limitations: token limits, no direct video parsing, and cost. So I created this tool to automate and speed up the process for myself.

It also convenient to store notes in one place :)
